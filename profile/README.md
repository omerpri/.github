## We are **Team Bit**

We build the [open-source tools](https://github.com/teambit/bit) that help people build **anything in components** and the [cloud platform](https://bit.cloud/) that helps teams scale to many projects and teams with components.  

We build everything in components, open-source and cloud alike. On our cloud you can find all our components and see how we built Bit with Bit.  

This is our official GitHub organization. We aim to open-source as much we can, and thanks to the highly extendible nature of Bit make it easy for every developer to contribute or make Bit their own. You can see how we build Bit and Bit Cloud in components on our official [Bit Cloud organization](https://bit.dev/teambit).
